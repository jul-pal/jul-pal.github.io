This site is a collection of thinking on flows: of people, capital, goods, and ideas. It investigates points of connection, barriers of entry, and potential detours, mapping out power centrality beyond the elusive. But it is perhaps to naive to be useful, albeit amusing nonetheless. 

##About me##
 Based in Munich, I work in Consulting by day, trying to help organization improve process- and procurement efficiency, and reduce their environmental footprint through their supply chain. I am a reflective conformist, unlikely to change the world, but believing that small positive (whatever this is) changes do matter.
