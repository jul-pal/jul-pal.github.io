The remarkable success of the capitalist modus operandi, coupled with the agnostic egalitarianism of the liberal democratic state, has lost its steam. So at least reads the common narrative. Indeed, since the universalist ambitions put forth by the technocratic elite in the Washington consensus, the rise of within-country inequality and political polarization in the West, as well as growing Chinese hegemony in the East, put into question the sustainability of an arrangement, that has so long consumed social, political, and economic life. Substantive efforts during the Occupy and des gilets jaunes movements to alter the logic of capital to seek its accumulation produced little lasting institutional change, not least because their demands were predominately transactional, and could hence be appeased by the same logic. Instead, the crisis of liberal democracy, and in extension the capitalist substantive rationality, which – as I contend – it failed to keep in check, stems from the faltering of their decentralized modes of propagation. The carving out of the average worker, consumer, and voter, whose self-assumed political impotence and (economic) desires ensures the arrangement’s stability, makes way for the normalizing of the extreme position.

Confronted with an increasing and – more importantly – deemed unjustified inequality of outcome, the moderate left tends to advocate for decelerating1 the ‘satanic mill’ of capitalism by pitting the Leviathan against it. Such calls have been met with equal vigour by defences of market fundamentalism, which is presumed a necessary safeguard to individual liberties. Although drawing such strict dichotomy is overly simplistic, I argue that both are necessarily flawed because they share the same incapacity to deal with some of the existential challenges of the present, most prominently that of climate change.

Likewise, implementing liberal democratic versions of capitalism in some countries may not necessarily be preferred to instantiations of state capitalism, as it depends on the stage of its economic development and the inherited socio-cultural preconditions that govern and sustain its institutions. This notion I illustrate in the case of China, where the government’s ability to shape the economic modes of production and constrain the market where considered necessary has helped to raise millions out of destitution, albeit at an enormous cost to environment and individual agency. And yet, as with increased economic development societal objectives
